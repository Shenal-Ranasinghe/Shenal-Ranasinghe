## 🧠 About Me

I’m the kind of engineer who loves to **master complex systems from scratch** — whether it's designing a **UHF RFID gate**, building a **GNSS jammer mitigation solution**, or diving into **mmWave front-end prototyping**. I enjoy challenges that require learning fast and solving real-world problems through a blend of **physics**, **simulation**, and **hands-on engineering**.

> "The specialty of an ENTC student isn’t that we know everything; it’s that we can master anything within a really slim period of time!"
